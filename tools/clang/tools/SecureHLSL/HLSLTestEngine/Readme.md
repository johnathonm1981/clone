# HLSL Test Engine

## How to build

This project is meant to be used with Visual Studio 2017 15.4 and the Windows SDK version 10.0.16299.15.

After building you can run the program from the HLSLTestEngine directory and it will find the Conformance test path and run the tests.

This uses WARP for D3D12 rendering so that it will have consistent results on each machine.
